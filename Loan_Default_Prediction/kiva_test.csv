The village is filled with Haitian immigrants and poverty is rampant. The program was dedicated to bettering the lives and providing opportunity to women who had been trapped within the cycle of poverty and prostitution. These women chose to spend 2 hours each day, for forty consecutive days, learning about the Gospel message, God's purpose for their lives, receiving extra medical attention, and learning basic skills such as sewing, making candles, and making jewelry, skills that could be used to start a new business. Each of these women found themselves in the desperate situation of prostitution as a last resort to feed their children. Through microfinance, beginning small businesses with $150 loans, these women will be able to find a new way to provide for their children with dignity. Several have decided to buy and sell clothes, traveling to the nearby city of Santiago to purchase shoes, pants, and shirts for resale in the villages. Others have chosen to open small shops in front of their homes where they are able to sell juice, bread, cookies, or fried foods while still taking care of their kids."

6621,"Maureen operates a second hand clothes business. She has been in this business for a period of one year and she got her initial capital from an informal rotating savings arrangment which her group used to have. This is commonly referred to as a merry go round. This is what she has been using to finance her business and ploughing back profits into her business. She is 29 years old and married with two children. Her business location is in a place called Maseno in the Kisumu district. Her business is near a university (Maseno University) and most of her clients are from the university community. She hopes to use the loan to increase her business stock so that she can carry more clothes in inventory of several varieties more consistently. This has been necessitated by the growing market due to increased dependence of the increasing student population on nearby clothes. Her clothes are preferred since they are cheaper than new clothes. She also intends to diversify into selling juice after having established and learned that it is a fast-paying business in the locality. Maureen uses the proceeds from her business to supplement her family's income as her husband's income is small. Her husband is employed in junior ranks and hence has little money to support the business. She saves part of the income for her children and ploughs back the rest to the business. This is her first loan both for her and for the group. She is a sub group leader and has displayed good leadership skills. Though this is the first time the group is taking a loan, they have displayed a high degree of cohesiveness during group preparation and training. All members of the group come on time and have shown commitment to follow group policies and procedures. The location of Maureen's business is very strategic as it is close to the university student community who are most of her customers. Most students and the community around can't afford to buy new clothes and hence her business has a high chance of growth."

1688,"The first loan of $ 450 Danson received through Kiva enabled him to make a quantifiable impact on his business. Danson invested the money in the farmers he partners with in order to increase production. The farmers used it to pay for medicine for sick cows, as well as increase their feed. Operating in a facility with a capacity to process 1200 liters, Danson had previously only been able to collect 500 liters of milk per day. With the help of his loan, his farmers have been able to produce about 600 liters in low season and 1000 liters in peak season. Not only does this mean that Danson can sell more milk to restaurants in Malaba, but the higher production also increases his profit on each liter. Because Danson has to hire a truck every day to transport the milk, he pays a fixed cost of 2000 Kenya Schillings per day (1 USD is about 65 Ksh). The price of 2000 Ksh. is the same no matter how many liters he transports, so he pays 2000 to carry 1 liter, and 2000 to carry 1000 liters. Now, he can end each day with 800 Ksh profit. Due to growth in his client base, the demand for his milk has grown and Danson finds himself unable to fully supply the necessary milk with the capital he has at hand. Danson has now applied for an additional $400 so that he can expand his milk stocks to better serve his clients.

The only difference is that Rita has 4 kids (depicted in the picture) and she needs to assist her husband (a fresh produce salesman himself) to supply their needs to make a living. Rita would like to ""become a professional"", meaning that she would like to have the opportunity to go to school and earn some degree, but we explained that ""professionalism"" doesn't come from degrees so much as from ""doing well whatever one does"" for a living! This seemed to enlighten her otherwise somber-looking composure, obviously stemming from the heavy load of having to care for such a large and growing family at this stage of their lives. She figures that she will no have much time to do her selling activity, thus she chose to sell shoes and the like, which bodes well with her needs of tending to her children and those around her. All of the kids that live under the same roof now (8 at this time) will need some kind of footwear, so this is a good place to start 'selling', and she plans to continue doing so in the close-by neighborhood. A 200% profit margin should allow Rita to be able to repay her loan and obtain the benefits of assisting herself in caring for the children. The market, at least in terms of number of kids, is certainly there."

Peter enrolled into Kigali Teachers College where he studied for one year. He then went through a very difficult period after his mother passed away after his first year in college. Unfortunately his father could not support him, since he now had another family. Due to this difficulty, he dropped out of college. He then went out and started off a small business selling groceries, but his working capital was small, and since he was still quite young, he was unable to manage the business properly and it collapsed. He then went to one of the slum areas called Kawangware, where he was employed to manage a beer pub. After about six months he was laid off. Peter then approached his uncle for help and fortunately his uncle took him in. His uncle then introduced him to selling second hand jeans at the Kenyatta market area. He started off here by working as a broker, whereby he would sell trousers on behalf of his uncle, and would then be given a small commission. With time, in the year 2001, he managed to put aside a little money from the commissions i.e. 500 (USD 8), which he used as his initial capital to purchase four pairs of jeans trousers. He sold them and was able to buy more jeans. One of his distant relatives suggested that he should consider selling stretch jeans since they would soon be coming into fashion, and he took the advice. For about seven years now he has specialized in the sale of stretch jeans, and he is glad he took the advice, since stretch jeans have become a favourite for many women who now form the bulk of his customers. Peter finds that the only reason he has not been able to expand his business is lack of capital, since he doesnt have collateral that would enable him to borrow from formal banks. He has so far managed to attract a regular flow of customers, and would like to increase his stock, so as to provide a better variety for them. Peter is therefore requesting a loan of USD75, with which he will buy additional jeans trousers in order to boost his stock. He intends to repay the loan over a period of 5 months."
