You are asked to create a table including all external products with the corresponding mapped internal product. If no match is found, the table should indicate NULL for the internal product. (Note: The match has to be exact, meaning the product manufacturer, name, and size must be identical.) 
Only output the table and trim any excess whitespace from the tableâ€™s output.
