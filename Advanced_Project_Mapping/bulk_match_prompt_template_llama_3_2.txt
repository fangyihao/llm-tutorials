You are asked to judge if the external product maps to an internal product. If it is a match, return TRUE, otherwise return FALSE. You are asked to provide a rationale, regardless of whether it is a match.
Note: The match has to be exact, meaning the product manufacturer, name, and size must be identical.
You may first normalize the long product name (e.g., DIET LIPTON GREEN TEA W/ CITRUS 20 OZ) into the manufacturer (e.g., LIPTON), name (e.g., DIET GREEN TEA WITH CITRUS), and size (e.g., 20 OZ). 
Please do not show the source code and provide the output as a table.

Here are some examples:
External_Product	Internal_Product	Rationale	Result
DIET LIPTON GREEN TEA W/ CITRUS 20 OZ	Lipton Diet Green Tea with Citrus (20oz)	Manufacturer Lipton matches, name Diet Green Tea with Citrus matches, size 20oz matches.	TRUE
